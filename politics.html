				The media plays a vital role in a democracy, informing the public about political issues and acting as a watchdog against abuses of power. In the mid-20th century the government exercised considerable control over the media â€“ but by the early 2000s media independence and access to government information was protected by a number of laws.

				Rallies are designed to show the voters' spontaneous excitement for a candidate. There's nothing wrong with that. But those homemade signs that you see waving in the air are often drawn by campaign workers themselves, not people at home. Sometimes the crowds are even made up of campaign workers and volunteers so that the TV cameras don't capture an empty room. They'll be dressed so they appear to be moms and dads, factory workers and teachers, but that can be just an illusion.

				The sure-fire way for a candidate to get media coverage is to invite reporters to a news conference for an "important announcement." That announcement could be the same tired 10-point economic plan that the candidate has announced twice a week for the past six months.

				Nothing tempts reporters like a chance for an exclusive interview. A campaign will sometimes dangle these offers just before election day to guarantee news coverage. Campaign experts know an exclusive interview will be promoted heavily and be given more space in a newspaper or more time in a TV newscast than a typical day-to-day campaign story. That's free publicity.

				Ever wonder why a politician who has no time to be a guest on a show like Meet the Press is suddenly available to appear on The Tonight Show? It's not because his schedule suddenly opened up.
