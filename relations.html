				The media is so powerful such that the negative reportage about an individual or organisation will affect their image or reputation. Conversely, positive reportage can also enhance the image and reputation of that organisation.The kind and amount of information disseminated by the media about an individual or organisation, brand, service or product would have a significant role in shaping perceptions.

				Information related to business is also a critical component for foreign businesses in deciding to invest in a country.The media presents a huge opportunity for the organisation to send certain messages about their organisation to the public and other stakeholders. As a result, developing good relations with the media becomes an essential activity.Paul Argenti, a public relations expert is quoted as saying that the media is both a constituency and a conduit through which investors, suppliers, retailers and consumers receive information about and develop images of the organisation.

			<p style="margin-top: 20px">
				Organisations use the media to gain “third-party endorsement”. The conventional wisdom is that information is more credible when conveyed by the media. This lies on the assumption that the media has no vested interest.Howes and Sallot assert that the “endorsement effect” is what has motivated public relations (PR) practitioners to consider when developing communication strategies.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">
				There is a long-held view in PR practice that information published or broadcast in news media takes on an added value because it has been approved by an independent third party gatekeeper and conveyed by an independent, supposedly unbiased news medium.There is the assumption that organisations are biased and guided by a self-interested perspective it wishes to advance.
