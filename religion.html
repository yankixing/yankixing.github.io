				The media influences the way in which the society think about religion, this is because a great percentage of the society gets information about the world through media. If we get much of our information about the world through media,the media will control what information we are exposed to. That would mean that the media controls what we think about, even if it does not necessarily control what we think

				New stories are often designed in a point/counter-point set-up, where two'sides' of an issue are discussed and/ or debated. An easy formula for a brief television news segment, for instance, would be to have two guests commenting on something trustworthy, from neighbourhood event to a Supreme court ruling. The achor then serves as moderator or facilitator for the two guests. The invited guests are seen as presenting certain group's offucual/general point of view. One obvious problem with one guest representing the 'religious' point of view is that there are numerous religions and religious sects, and it is beyond the scope of one guest representing them. However, when the guest is asked to respond to a Supreme court ruling on Marriage Equality, the guest is seen by viewers as responding from the 'religious' perspective. This discounts thw widely varying official responses one might hear fromUniversal Unitarian or a Roman catholic. Viewers generalize, and the media format encourages this generalization. Simply by presenting the religious guest as holding the opposing viewpoint, the media is non-verbally stating 'the oher viewpoint is opposed by the religious establishment'

				In addition, depending on the guest's and moderator's styles, the discussion can become quite heated. The guest's views are necessarily polarized, as each has been invited to give an opposing view. This set-up is not conducive to collaboration or reconciliation, and shows are more interesting to many viewers when the guests are more apt to disagree. The result is that the 'religious' perspective is often less moderate than it may be in general practice
